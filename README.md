# A Minimalist Approach to Offline Reinforcement Learning With Data Augmentation

TD3+BC+SVEA is a simple approach to offline RL where: 
- A weighted behavior cloning loss is added to the policy update
- The states are normalized
- Q-Learning is stabilized with ConvNets and Vision Transformers under Data Augmentation
